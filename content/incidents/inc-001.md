A significant performance degradation was detected in our web application, causing slow response times and occasional timeouts for users. Our engineering team identified a memory leak in the caching layer as the root cause and implemented a fix.

**Root Cause**: A memory leak in the application's caching layer was causing gradual performance degradation.

**Resolution**: The engineering team implemented proper cache cleanup procedures and optimized memory management in the affected components.

**Impact**: Users experienced slow page loads and occasional timeouts during the incident period.
